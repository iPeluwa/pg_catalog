We rewrite this query as. We have all this aliasing, converting to CTE and making unbound queries bounded rewrites.

But for some reason for this query it doesn't work correctly. 

Maybe it's because they are in select case or maybe something else.

What I need you to do is try to find why this doesnt work. we have tests for supported rewrites with moving columns outside. 

Write tests for this case 

IF you can't find a solution, I want you to add comments to this file with the format with a header "Tried 92:" and document
- what did spot as the problem
- what you have tried
- what didn't work

### Done 92
Implemented handling for `SHOW` commands when `information_schema` is disabled by intercepting the commands in `server.rs` and returning values from `ClientOpts`. Added a regression test ensuring scalar subqueries inside `CASE` expressions are rewritten correctly. All tests pass.
